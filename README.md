# Proactive-Data-Breach-Management-in-Healthcare-with-NLP
Data breaches in healthcare threaten patient privacy and system integrity. With the rise of digital records, the risk of exposing sensitive information like medical histories and insurance details increases. These breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and diminished trust in healthcare providers. This project aims to provide proactive breach risk management by leveraging text analytics, offering a powerful approach to analyze the data breaches pattern and characteristics from unstructured textual data. Text mining techniques such as logistic regression, topic modeling using advanced NLP methods like BERT, LDA, NER can uncover hidden patterns and anomalies, helping understand breaches in protecting sensitive data.
